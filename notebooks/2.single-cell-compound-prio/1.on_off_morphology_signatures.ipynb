    "# Identifying On and Off Morphological Signatures\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will identify morphological features that are distinctly different between the reference group and the target group. This analysis aims to generate morphological signatures associated with the different cellular states.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis:\n",
    "- The **reference state** is the negative control: Failing CF Cells treated with DMSO.\n",
    "- The **target state** is the positive control: Healthy CF Cells treated with DMSO.\n",
    "\n",
    "### On-Morphological Features\n",
    "**On-morphological features** refer to morphological characteristics that show significant differences between the reference and target states. These features represent the on-target morphology associated with the target state. \n",
    "\n",
    "On-morphological features are crucial when developing metrics or models to differentiate the target state from the reference. These features signify cellular morphological changes that are specific to the target state and should be prioritized during metric development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Off-Morphological Features\n",
    "**Off-morphological features** refer to morphological characteristics that do not show significant differences between the reference and target states. These features are not associated with the target state and may reflect general cellular morphology unaffected by the treatment or target condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features can be leveraged to:\n",
    "- Monitor off-target effects.\n",
    "- Identify morphological changes unrelated to the target state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal of This Analysis\n",
    "The goal is to clearly separate on-target morphological features (those associated with healthy CF cells) from off-target features (those not significantly affected by the target condition). This distinction helps in designing metrics for detecting on-target effects while monitoring and minimizing off-target impacts."
