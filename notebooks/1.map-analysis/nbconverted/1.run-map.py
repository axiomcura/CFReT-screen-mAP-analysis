# # 1. Executing Mean Average Precision (mAP)
#
# Mean Average Precision (mAP) is a flexible statistical framework used to measure the **phenotypic activity** of compounds by comparing them to control groups. In this notebook, we utilize high-content screening data, that used the CellPainting assay, to identify potential drug candidates that demonstrate evidence of reversing the effects of cardiac fibrosis. The dataset comprises **image-based profiles at the replicate level (well-level)**.
#
# #### **Controls Used in the Screen**
# To interpret mAP scores, we leverage the following control groups:
# - **Negative control**: Failing CF cells treated with DMSO.
# - **Positive control**: Healthy CF cells treated with DMSO.
#
# #### **Interpreting mAP Scores**
# - **High mAP Scores**:
#   Indicate that wells treated with a specific compound are highly phenotypically distinct compared to the control. This suggests the compound induces a strong and specific phenotypic change.
#
# - **Low mAP Scores**:
#   Indicate that wells treated with a specific compound are phenotypically similar to the control. This suggests the compound has little to no phenotypic effect or a nonspecific one.
#
# #### **Biological Interpretation**
# mAP scores help determine which compounds exhibit phenotypic changes that resemble those of healthy cells, making them potential candidates for reversing the effects of cardiac fibrosis. By comparing the phenotypic activity of compounds to both positive and negative controls, we can prioritize compounds for further validation.
#
# **what is outputed**
# - AP scores generated using both the postive and negvative controls
# - mAP scores generated using both the postive and negative controls

# In this section, the code processes and organizes data by grouping related files and enriching them with additional metadata. Each group is assigned a unique identifier, and the corresponding data files are systematically loaded and prepared. New metadata columns are generated by combining existing information to ensure consistency and clarity. Additional metadata is integrated into the data to provide valuable experimental context, while unique identifiers are added to distinguish the aggregated profiles from different batches.

# In this section, we analyze a high-content screening dataset generated from cell painting experiments, where failing cardiac fibroblasts are treated with multiple compounds. Our goal is to calculate the mean average precision (mAP) by comparing the experimental treatments to two controls: a negative control consisting of DMSO-treated failing cardiac fibroblasts and a positive control consisting of DMSO-treated healthy cardiac fibroblasts.
#
# We start by preparing the dataset, copying the profiles, and assigning a reference index to ensure proper grouping of non-DMSO treatment replicates. Metadata and feature columns are separated to facilitate the calculation of average precision (AP) scores. To calculate these scores, we define positive pairs as treatments with the same metadata values (e.g., same treatment type) across all plates. Negative pairs, on the other hand, are determined by comparing all DMSO-treated wells across all plates with all other treatments.
#
# Once the AP scores are computed, we aggregate them across all plates for each treatment to derive the mean average precision (mAP) score. This process captures the consistency of treatment performance relative to the controls and allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the dataset. Finally, we save both the AP and mAP scores for each control condition, providing a well-structured dataset for further interpretation and downstream analysis.
